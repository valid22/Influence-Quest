## Influence Quest: My Career Simulator

This repository contains the final project for **MGTA 459: Managerial Judgment and Decision Making** (Part II: Influence). The project is a **Twine-style branching narrative game** implemented as a single HTML file.

The goal is to create a **personal, replayable “influence cheat sheet”** for my future self – a way to practice and remember the core influence concepts from the course in realistic career situations.

## Files

- `index.html`  
  The complete playable game (**Influence Quest**). Open this file in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) to play.

- `influencer_quest_summary.md`  
  A written summary of each chapter, the main decision points, and the consequences. This is useful for the written reflection and for quickly reviewing the influence logic without playing through every branch.

## How to Run

1. **Download / clone** this folder to your machine.
2. Double‑click `index.html` (or open it via `File → Open` in your browser).
3. The game runs entirely in the browser – **no server or install is required**.

If the stats or UI ever look stuck, you can **refresh the page** to restart from the Prologue.

## Game Structure (High Level)

Influence Quest is organized into a **Prologue**, **five chapters**, and a **dynamic Epilogue**:

- **Prologue** – Frames the game as my personal influence simulator.
- **Chapter 1 – Networks** – Early‑career networking: weak/strong ties, brokers, social capital.
- **Chapter 2 – Coalitions** – Project Horizon: top‑down power vs. coalition‑building, calling people in vs. calling them out.
- **Chapter 3 – Persuasion** – Pricing pilot with Elena: social proof, authority, consistency, story vs. data dumps.
- **Chapter 4 – Power & Leverage** – Promotion window with Maya: expert power, relational power, visibility, and “quiet excellence”.
- **Chapter 5 – Organizational Influence** – Leading a team through a Project Oxygen–style change initiative.
- **Epilogue** – A **stat‑driven career outcome** (e.g., fast‑tracked & promoted, stalled contributor, over‑leveraged politician, under‑networked expert, managed out/fired).

Each chapter uses:

- A **chat‑style UI** (WhatsApp‑like bubbles and avatars) so every choice feels like a real reply.
- At least **3 choices per decision step**, often with nested sub‑choices.
- A shared **stat system**:
  - **Trust**, **Network**, **Reputation**, **Power**.
  - Choices adjust these stats and unlock or block later chapters and endings.

## How This Maps to MGTA 459 (Influence)

The game is explicitly designed to reflect the main Influence topics:

- **Networks** (Burt, social capital, structural holes) → Chapter 1.
- **Coalitions & Power** (Pfeffer, coalitions, Saudi Arabia of Sashimi) → Chapter 2.
- **Persuasion** (Cialdini, Made to Stick, nudging) → Chapter 3.
- **Influence Toolbox / Power & Leverage** (expert vs positional power, visibility, political capital) → Chapter 4.
- **Influence & Organizational Change** (Google’s Project Oxygen, promotions and manager behaviors) → Chapter 5.

Every major scene ends with an **“Influence reflection”** that names the tactic or failure mode and connects it back to the course concepts.

## Using This as a Personal Cheat Sheet

For **future me**, the intended use is:

- **Replay different paths** when starting a new role, pitching a risky idea, or leading a change.
- Notice when I’m drifting into known failure modes:
  - Data dumps, avoiding hard conversations, over‑relying on top‑down power, hiding from visibility, or doing “quiet excellence” only.
- Use the stat outcomes and Epilogue archetypes as a **mirror**:
  - Am I behaving like a “balanced influence architect”, “under‑networked expert”, “over‑leveraged politician”, or “stalled contributor”?

The hope is that this makes the Influence half of MGTA 459 **sticky and actionable** long after the course is over.
